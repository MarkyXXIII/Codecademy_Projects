## General info
The purpose of this repository is to show the mini-projects that I've written during my studies with Codecademy.
Below, I will list the Statments/Methods etc. used for each project, along with a brief description of the project.

## BlackjackCounter.js
- Switch statements
- If/else loops

This is a card counting tool for the game Blackjack.

## CreditCardValidation.js
- Arrays, push()
- If/else loops
- Switch statements

This uses the Luhn algorithm to determine whether a credit card number is valid or not. It will also report which company issued an invalid card if possible.

## FindYourHat.js
