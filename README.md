## General info
The purpose of this repository is to show the mini-projects that I've written during my studies with Codecademy.
Below, I will list the Statments/Methods etc. used for each project, along with a brief description of the project.

## Blackjack Counter
- Switch statements
- If/else loops

This is a card counting tool for the game Blackjack.

## Credit Card Validation
- Arrays, .push()
- If/else loops
- Switch statements

This uses the Luhn algorithm to determine whether a credit card number is valid or not. It will also report which company issued an invalid card if possible.

## Find Your Hat
- For loops
- If loops
- If/else loops
- While loops
- Do/while loops
- Classes
- Switch statements

A game that runs in node.js. It generates a random maze with obstacles, which you can traverse by moving up, down, left and right until you find your hat!

## Meal Maker
- Objects
- Arrays
- Math .floor(), .random()

Automatically generates a random three course meal from the three arrays, and adds up your bill.

## Rock Paper Scissors

## Rock Paper Scissors Bomb

## Sleep Debt Calculator

## Team Stats

## Tip Calculator

## Training Days
