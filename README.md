## Blackjack Counter
- Switch statements
- If/else loops

This is a card counting tool for the game Blackjack.

## Credit Card Validation
- Arrays, .push()
- If/else loops
- Switch statements

This uses the Luhn algorithm to determine whether a credit card number is valid or not. It will also report which company issued an invalid card if possible.

## Find Your Hat
- For loops
- If loops
- If/else loops
- While loops
- Do/while loops
- Classes
- Switch statements

A game that runs in node.js. It generates a random maze with obstacles, which you can traverse by moving up, down, left and right until you find your hat!

## Meal Maker
- Objects
- Arrays
- Math .floor(), .random()

Automatically generates a random three course meal from the three arrays, and adds up your bill.

## Rock Paper Scissors
- If loops
- If/else loops
- Switch statements

The classic Rock Paper Scissors game. Input one of the three options as an argument. The computer also chooses one and will determine win, lose or draw.

## Rock Paper Scissors Bomb
- If loops
- If/else loops
- Switch statements

Same as the standard game, except for a built in cheat! Input "bomb" and you'll win every time!

## Sleep Debt Calculator
- If/else loops

Adds up the hours that you've slept in a week, works out the average and then informs you if you've had too much, too little, or just the right amount of sleep.

## Team Stats
- Objects

This is a basic library detailing the stats of multiple members of multiple teams, in which individual stats can be pulled.

## Tip Calculator
- Switch statements

Takes the quality of service and the total of the bill as arguements, and then returns the total with the tip added dependant on the quality of service.

## Training Days
- If/else loops
- Math .floor(), .random()

Uses a random number generator to pick an event at random, and then inform you of how many days you should train.

## Whale Talk
- Arrays .push(), .join(), .toUpperCase()
- For loops
- If loops
- If/else loops

This takes a string, alters it's contents and returns an amended array.
